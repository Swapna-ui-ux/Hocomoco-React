Other Services when clearly and explicitly designated may be provided and billed for by Timeshell ("Timeshell Services"). The Vendor Services and the Timeshell Services are referred to collectively as the "Provided Services."
                          <br/> Account. In order to use the Provided Services, you must register and maintain an account with us ("Account").

                          <br/> Charges. You agree that use of the Vendor Services will result in charges to you for the products or services provided by Vendors ("Vendor Charges") and that use of the Timeshell Services will result in charges to you for the products or services provided by Timeshell ("Timeshell Charges") (Timeshell Charges and Vendor Charges, collectively, "Charges"). You will be informed of Charges before products or services are provided by Timeshell or Vendors, as applicable (including cancellation fees and terms, if any). You should confirm Charges each time you request products or services. Applicable sales tax will be added to all Charges where required by law.
                          <br/> Payment. Payments for Charges are immediately due upon provision of the applicable products or services and Timeshell will facilitate payment in accordance with the payment method specified in your Account. Payments are final and non-refundable. Timeshell may, in its discretion, facilitate your payment of Vendor Charges on behalf of a Vendor as such vendor’s limited payment collection agent. Payment of the vendor Charges in such manner shall be considered the same as payment made directly by you to the Vendor. You acknowledge and agree that your purchases of services and products from a Vendor are transactions between you and that Vendor, and not with Timeshell.
